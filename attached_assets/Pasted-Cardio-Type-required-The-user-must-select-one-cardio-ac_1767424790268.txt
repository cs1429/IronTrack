Cardio Type (required): The user must select one cardio activity before entering other data. Supported types include outdoor run, treadmill run, walk/hike, outdoor cycling, stationary cycling, rowing (erg), elliptical, stair climber, swimming, jump rope, HIIT/intervals, and other cardio. The selected cardio type determines which fields are shown.

Core Fields (shown for all cardio workouts): Duration is required and should accept formats such as total minutes (e.g., “45”), “mm:ss”, or “hh:mm:ss”. Effort/intensity is optional and can be captured as Easy/Moderate/Hard or via an RPE scale from 1–10. Notes are optional as a free-text field for user comments. Heart rate is optional and should allow average heart rate and maximum heart rate.

Distance, Pace, and Speed Logic: Distance, pace, and speed should be optional and auto-computed when possible. Distance should only be shown when relevant and should support units including miles, kilometers, meters, and yards. Pace or speed should be shown depending on the cardio type: running, walking, and swimming should use pace in min:sec per mile or km; cycling should use speed in mph or km/h; rowing should use split pace in min:sec per 500m. Auto-calculation rules should work as follows: if the user enters duration plus distance, the app auto-calculates pace/speed; if the user enters duration plus pace/speed, the app auto-calculates distance; if all three are entered manually, the app keeps the user input and skips calculation.

Type-Specific Fields (examples): Outdoor run and hike can include optional elevation gain. Treadmill run can include optional incline percentage. Stationary cycling can include an optional resistance level. Rowing can include optional strokes per minute. Swimming can include optional pool length (25m, 50m, 25yd, etc.). Stair climber can include optional floors climbed or total steps. Jump rope can include optional total jumps.

Intervals Mode: The user can choose Steady State or Intervals. When Intervals is selected, show work duration, rest duration, and number of rounds. An optional advanced mode can allow a list of interval steps, such as 400m run plus 90s rest.

Data Output Structure (example): Each saved cardio workout should store the cardio type, duration (stored in seconds), distance (value plus unit if applicable), pace or speed (value plus unit if applicable), effort level, heart rate data, type-specific metrics, interval structure if used, notes, and a timestamp.

UX Principles: Only show fields relevant to the selected cardio type, minimize required inputs so type plus duration is enough to save, automatically calculate metrics when possible, allow manual overrides for advanced users, and keep the main form simple with advanced metrics hidden behind optional sections.
